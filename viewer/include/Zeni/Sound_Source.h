 * \brief Plays Sound Data
 *
 * This Sound_Source is directly tied to the OpenAL driver "hardware".
 * This is the original Zeni::Sound_Source, which has been replaced
 * by a much saner frontend to Sound_Source_Pool (which in turn manages
 * the Sound_Source_HW objects).
 *
 * \warning Don't use this unless you find that you need to.

 * \class Zeni::Sound_Source
 *
 * \ingroup zenilib
 *
 * \brief Plays Sound Data
 *
 * A Sound_Source plays sound data from a Sound_Buffer.  The term comes
 * from the idea that OpenAL is built for 3D positional sound.  A Sound_Source
 * is defined by the Sound_Buffer it is playing as well as its position, 
 * velocity, and several other factors.
