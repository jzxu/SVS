<!-- Images to load into the Textures Database in zenilib
     Sprites to build in the Textures Database in zenilib

For each Texture entry in Textures:

  1. 'token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'is_sprite' should be 0 (or absent [deprecated])
  3. 'filepath' should be the path from within 'zenilib/'
  4. 'tile' should be 0 for best quality if tiling is unnecessary
     'tile' should be 1 to enable tiling (for *ALL* textures for .3ds 'Model's)
       
     If 'tile' is 1 and tiling is not desired, floating point
     error can make things look worse at the edges of tiles.

For each Sprite entry in Textures:

  1. 'sprite_token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'is_sprite' should be 1
  3. 'token's should be the tokens of existing Textures
     'file's should be standard Texture entries (see above)
       the 'token' for the frame will be 'sprite_token/frame_number'
     
     All 'token's must have been defined earlier in the file.
     'token's defined later in the file will be ignored.

The following formats are supported:

  1. PNG is supported with 8 bits per channel.
  2. BMP is fully supported AFAIK.
  3. TIFF is supported with 8 bits per channel.
     TIFF supports deflate and JPEG compression.

The following things are unsupported:

  1. JPEG and GIF images
  2. Indexed color
  3. Indexed transparency
  4. Anything other than 8 bits per channel
