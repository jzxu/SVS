<!-- Sound files to load into the Sounds Database in zenilib

For each entry in Sounds:

  1. 'token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'filepath' should be the path from within 'zenilib/',
     without a file extension.

On Android, only .wav is supported.
Otherwise, only .ogg is supported.
To support both, two sets of audio files are necessary.

Stereo sounds are unaffected by positional audio.  They must 
be downmixed to mono if you want them to work with OpenAL's
positional audio functionality.

HOWTO:  To convert between types, or to downmix to mono,
        (1) Open in Audacity, obtainable from http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
              or http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/audacity_portable
        (2) To the left of the waveform that appears, left-click on effect
              and left-click on Split Stereo Track
        (3) To the left of each of the split waveforms, left-click on effect
              and left-click on Mono
        (4) Go to File->Export As Ogg Vorbis
